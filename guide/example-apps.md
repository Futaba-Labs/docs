# Example Apps

Here are some ideas for use cases for Futaba using queries in practice.

### Single query

Refers to one-to-one queries. For example, ENS on Ethereum can be used to authenticate other Layer2s or issue new NFTs or FTs in a more secure way.

### Multiple queries

Refers to one-to-many queries. For example, there is a cross-chain yield aggregator that queries the APY of each lending protocol for each chain, compares them, and rebalances them to the most optimal lending protocol.

Another possible example is a cross-chain voting system that allows voting from multiple chains and aggregating the voting data.
