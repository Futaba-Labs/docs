# Example Apps



### Single query

Refers to one-to-one queries. For example, ENS on Ethereum can be used to authenticate other Layer2s or issue new NFTs or Fungible Tokens in a more secure way.



### Multiple queries

Refers to one-to-many queries. For example, there is a cross-chain yield aggregator that queries the APY of each lending protocol for each chain, compares them, and rebalances them to the most optimal lending protocol.

**Omni-chain lending**: Deposit, withdraw, lend and borrow across any chains.
