  Futaba is a cross-chain protocol that pulls on-chain data by querying the
  state of other chains seamlessly and with minimal trust. Dapps building on
  Futaba are interoperable and "pull-based".

# Introduction



**BUILD INTEROPERABLE:** Query data from 1-to-N number of rollups and/or chains.&#x20;

**SECURED MODULARLY:** Developers freely choose their security / validation model, enabling cross-chain communication tailored to their Dapps and ecosystems. It can be combined with other messaging protocols to create more flexible and secure cross-chain Dapps. For example,  developers can&#x20;

### **USECASES / DAPPS**

**Reduced transaction fees** - Query and access yield/reward balances on Ethereum mainnet from rollups or Layer 2s at much lower fees, compared to withdrawing the yield balance from mainnet itself.\
**Usecases / dapps:** LST, Perp DEXes, Yield aggregators

**Reduced developer hours to scale to other chains/rollups** - With Futaba integrated, dapp users on chain/rollup X, Y, Z, can access balances on mainnet, instead of deploying another set of contracts and liquidity on another chain/rollup to scale every time.\
**Usecases / dapps:** AMMs, DEXes, Perp DEXes
