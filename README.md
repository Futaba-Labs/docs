# Futaba Introduction

Futaba is a cross-chain query infrastructure that can query the state of other chains seamlessly and with minimal trust. Futaba also allows developers to freely choose their security model, enabling cross-chain communications tailored to their Dapps and ecosystems. It can be combined with other messaging protocols to create more flexible and secure cross-chain Dapps.
